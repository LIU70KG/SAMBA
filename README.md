# SAMBA

The relevant code for the paper "SAMBA: Sample-Adaptive Modality Balancing via Self-Enhancement for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis".

## Overview
SAMBA is a multimodal sentiment analysis framework that:

- 1: Learns sample-level modality contributions 
 
	
- 2: Enhances weak modalities via self-enhancement (without cross-modal noise)


- 3: Improves both performance and interpretability
## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9
- PyTorch ==2.2.1+cu118
- Specific environmental requirements can be found in the file "requirements. txt"

## Train
Operation process:

- 1: Program entrance: folder 'train.py'
 
	
- 2: Hyperparameter optimization entrance: 'train_optuna.py'


## Dataset
  Obtain MOSI and MOSEI datasets from official channels and put them into the datasets file.
  
  Specific operation tips can be found in the datasets file.

Data Download

Install CMU Multimodal SDK. Ensure, you can perform from mmsdk import mmdatasdk.

Option 1: Download pre-computed splits and place the contents inside datasets folder.

Option 2: Re-create splits by downloading data from MMSDK. For this, simply run the code as detailed next.

## Results

SAMBA achieves strong performance on benchmark datasets:

| Dataset | MAE ↓ |
|--------|------|
| MOSI   | 0.639 |
| MOSEI  | 0.502 |
